# Serkan Onal JavaScript Financial Console Project

## Description

This first JavaScript project was created in order to show my ability to work with JavaScript code, EDX provided the starter code to which i had to add and improve to make this into a functional financial calculator.

As my first JavaScript assignment i had to use what had been taught/ provided by EDX in the first week to code a financial calculator.

Prior to adding any of my own code i was provided with a dataset with an array with two fields of data, a date and profit/ losses.

The financial calculator which i was tasked to code is to be used to analyze the records and to calculate the follow:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Once all the required analyses are done, these should be outputted to the console with the figures.


 Some considerations beforehand and during the development. 

- ***Clean and consistant Code*** -Clean code with useful naming conventions.
- ***Code Reusablitiy*** - Provide code which is DRY, reusing existing code to form new functions.
- ***Responsive Design*** -Research on how to achieve specific functions or tasks using what has been taught as far from EDX.
- ***Plan Code*** - Think about what will be required ahead of coding, plan what variables, methods and concepts to adopt in code before writting any code.

- **What was the motivation for this project**
  <br> 
  I wanted to show my case ability to understand working with JavaScript.

  I wanted to use what was taught from in introduction in JavaScript from EDX and adapt those teachings into this project and try gain further understanding of JavaScript and how it can be used within real world projects.

  I wanted to use this project to gauge my understand of JavaScript so that i would be able to identify areas which will require improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
- **Why was this project built**
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  1. To allow people/ employers the ability view my understanding of JavaScript.
  <br>
  1. To demonstrate my ability using JavaScript however limited the teaching has been.
  <br>
  1. To gauge my understanding of JavaScript to identify areas for improvement for further projects in the future.
<br>

- **The problems that where solved in this project**
<br>
 1. The ability to understand and use JavaScript, working with new concepts within the JavaScript language.<br><br>
 2. Using variables, arrays, if statements, if-else statements and for-loops to obtain and extraction information to provide a useful output.
 3. To take information from a data set and manlipulate with methods to output information that is useful for finanical analyses.


- What did you learn?<br>
  
  1. I leant how to declare variables, setup arrays, use loops and if-statements to output useful information.
  <br><br>
  1. Using Pseudocode to help break down a task into smaller segments.
  <br><br>
  1. Pair programming and how working with another developer can help gain a new prospective on tasks/ methods.
